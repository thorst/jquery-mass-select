(jquery-mass-select) [http://thorst.github.io/jquery-mass-select]
==================

A massively capable multiselect. Focusing on insanely large lists.

My goal is to make a plug-in so capable it would be a irresponsible to use it to its full extent

Default styling is bootstrap 3, but can be used without.

Tested current state in:
iOS7
win7
  ie11
  ie10(emulated)
  ie9 (emulated)
  ie8 (emulated)
  chrome
  firefox
